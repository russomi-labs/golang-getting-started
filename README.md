Getting Started tutorials for Go

## Tutorial: Get started with Go

In this tutorial, you'll get a brief introduction to Go programming. Along the way, you will:

- Install Go (if you haven't already).
- Write some simple "Hello, world" code.
- Use the go command to run your code.
- Use the Go package discovery tool to find packages you can use in your own code.
- Call functions of an external module.

### Install Go

- [Download and install](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Install via Brew on macOS:

``` bash

# output a list of what you can install
brew search golang

# Go ahead and install it
brew install golang

# check the version of Go
go version

# to update Go, you can run the following commands
brew update
brew upgrade golang

```

### Write some code

Create a hello directory for your first Go source code.

``` BASH
mkdir hello
cd hello
```

In your text editor, create a file hello.go in which to write your code.

``` Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Run your code to see the greeting.

``` BASH
$ go run hello.go

Hello, World!
```

``` BASH
$ go help

```

### Call code in an external package

When you need your code to do something that might have been implemented by someone else, you can look for a package that has functions you can use in your code.

- Visit [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev) and search for a "quote" package.
- Locate and click the `rsc.io/quote` package in search results (if you see rsc.io/quote/v3, ignore it for now).

``` Go
package main

import "fmt"

import "rsc.io/quote"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(quote.Go())
}
```

- Put your own code in a module for tracking dependencies.

``` BASH
go mod init hello
```

- Run your code to see the message generated by the function you are calling.

``` BASH
$ go run hello.go

go: finding module for package rsc.io/quote
go: found rsc.io/quote in rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
```

## Tutorial: Create a Go module

In this [tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module) you'll create two modules.

- The first is a library which is intended to be imported by other libraries or applications.
- The second is a caller application which will use the first.

This tutorial's sequence includes six brief topics that each illustrate a different part of the language.

- Create a module -- Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.
- Call your code from another module -- Import and use your new module.
- Return and handle an error -- Add simple error handling.
- Return a random greeting -- Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays).
- Return greetings for multiple people -- Store key/value pairs in a map.
- Add a test -- Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.
- Compile and install the application -- Compile and install your code locally.
